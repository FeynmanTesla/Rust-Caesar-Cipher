# Rust-Caesar-Cipher
A Rust program that encodes and decodes text according to Caesar ciphers via a GUI or CLI. It can automatically decode ciphertext whose shift size is unknown.

# Installation and building
It is a prerequisite to have Cargo installed. Install it with rustup (recommended) at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.
With Cargo installed, run "cargo build --release" from the root directory of the repository.
The executable will then be built at target/release/rust_caesar_cipher (from the repository root).
